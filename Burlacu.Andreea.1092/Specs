1) Title of the bachelor topic:
Mobile Braicar, an application for public transport information application 
for the city of Braila 

2) Design Patterns: 
	A) Singleton:
	-efficient management of application's SharedPreferences
	Advantages:
	-singly managing the settings and preferences for the app
	-easy to implement
	Disadvantages:
	-can become a bottleneck that can affect he app performance
	
	B) Factory
	-implementing a mechanism that allows the user to customize a route 
	according to their necessities at the time
	Advantages:
	-common interface that allows for future types of objects 
	-easy to implement
	Disadvantages:
	-new objects can't be generated
	-private constructors 
	
	C) BUILDER
	-building complex types of objects (such as a bus)
	Advantages:
	-allows variety when it comes to internal representation
	-buses are instantiated in a complete state
	Disadvantages:
	-the number of lines of code in the Bus class increase
	
	D) PROTOTYPE
	-allows the creation of a bus model 
	Advantages:
	-easily cloning objects
	
	E) DECORATOR 
	-extending profile for passangers 
	Advantages:
	-making the interface more customizable
	-allows decoration for objects
