Code review

1.Code structure and naming conventions 

-the package name is too generic; where is the module name?
-the class name is saying nothing;
-the function name is too generic;
-the function arguments names are not ok;
-t and s must have meaningful names;


2.Implementation

-too many "magic numbers" (hard coded values)
-is t limited to {1, 2, 3, 4}?
-there are no validations for t, s and perioada

3.Single Responsability & KISS
-outsource the intermediary operations
